## Assessment

### Individual Assignments
- Done individually
- Graded based on meeting all requirements by the deadline
- Grade of ‘A’ requires all assignments on time and functional

---

### Group Assignments
- Work in groups of 3–5
- Notify the instructor of group members by the end of January
- Grading primarily based on group product quality
- Individual contributions evaluated via GitHub commits if needed

---

### Submission Policy
- **No Late Submissions**:
  - Assignments due at **noon** on the due date
  - GitHub snapshot taken at the deadline
- **Recommendation**:
  - Set an internal deadline a day earlier than the due date

## AI Policy

- Use of tools like Copilot, ChatGPT, and generative AI is permitted
- AI is a productivity enhancer but not a substitute for understanding
- **Rules**:
  1. Students are individually responsible for all submissions.
  2. Acknowledge use of reference works, websites, and AI tools in comments.
