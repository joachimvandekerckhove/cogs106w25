# COGS 106 LEC A: COMPUT LAB SKILLS (61720)

## Course description
This course provides an in-depth introduction to skills needed to conduct projects of a computational nature, with a focus on research in cognitive sciences. General topics covered include computational reproducibility, version control, and writing high-quality, maintainable code in modern programming and development paradigms. Specific topics vary but may include numerical simulations, model fitting, and numerical methods for integration and optimization. Regular programming assignments will ensure that students master the techniques presented. Material includes working in a Linux environment and using common collaboration tools. The programming language used is PythonLinks to an external site.

## Prerequisites
(PSYC 14M or PSYC 114M or COGS 14P or ICS 31) and (PSYC 10C or STAT 7 or STAT 110).

## Flipped lectures
Part of the course material will consist of recorded lectures, which students should review each week before class time. Recorded lectures will be published on Monday afternoons. In-person meetings happen on Wednesdays 4pm-4:50pm, and virtual meetings (with optional attendance) will happen on Fridays 4pm-4:50pm.

## Assessment
Grades will be based on individual and group assignments. Individual assignments should be done individually. The homework assignments have particular requirements. Your grade depends entirely on how much of the requirements you deliver by the assignment deadline. A grade of ‘A’ requires that all assignments are delivered on time and are functional.

For group assignments, you must work in groups of three to five. You should let me know by the end of January who your group members are, or if you do not have a group yet (in which case I will assign you to a group). Grading of group projects will be based primarily on the quality of group products. In case of disagreement between group members, I will also take into account individual contributions as shown in the quality of your individual GitHub commits.

### No late submissions
All assignments are due on the due date at noon. For assignments submitted via GitHub, I will take a snapshot of your group's GitHub repository at noon on the due date. You will have at least a week for each assignment, so late submissions will not be allowed. I recommend each group set an internal deadline that is a day or so earlier than the assignment due date.

## AI policy
The use of reference works or searching the internet is permitted, even encouraged, during the preparation of assignments. Similarly, you are free to use tools like Copilot, ChatGPT, and similar generative AI and other coding assistance tools. These can be excellent productivity enhancers for users who already have expertise in the area. That is, if you already know how to solve a problem, these tools will help you produce code faster and with less typing. However, if you do not know how to get started or how to conceptualize a coding problem, they are just as likely to lead you astray.

Consequently, the use of AI, just like other resources, is subject to two basic rules:
1. All students are individually responsible for everything they submit, and
2. You must acknowledge your use of reference works, websites, AI tools, and so on (with comments in your submitted code). 

It is expected that all students are able to produce reasonable and error-free solutions to each of the assignments -- with or without use of these tools.

## Academic dishonesty
There is no tolerance for academic dishonesty or fraud. Any form of fraud designed to circumvent course policies will result in a failing grade. The professor makes no judgment calls regarding academic dishonesty. Any academic dishonesty, no matter how small, will be escalated to academic authorities.
